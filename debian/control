Description: ECMWF meteorological plotting software library
 Magics++ is the latest generation of the ECMWF's Meteorological plotting
 software MAGICS. Although completely redesigned in C++, it is intended to be
 as backwards-compatible as possible with the Fortran interface.
 Besides its programming interfaces (Fortran and C), Magics++ offers MagML,
 a plot description language based on XML aimed at automatic web production.
 .
 The library supports the plotting of contours, wind fields, observations,
 satellite images, symbols, text, axis and graphs (including boxplots).
 .
 Data fields to be plotted may be presented in various formats,
 for instance GRIB 1 and 2 code data, Gaussian grid, regularly spaced grid
 and fitted data. Input data can also be in BUFR and NetCDF format
 or retrieved from an ODB database.
 .
 The produced meteorological plots can be saved in various formats,
 such as PostScript, EPS, PDF, GIF, PNG, SVG and KML.
